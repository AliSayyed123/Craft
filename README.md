## Craft -Note Taking App -Landing Page
This is a responsive landing page for Craft, an app for notes, tasks, and organizing ideas. Itâ€™s built using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript for interactivity. The page has:
-A fixed header with navigation and a mobile hamburger menu.
-A hero section with visual elements like clouds, mountains, and waves.
-Mockup cards showing tasks, notes, calendars, and lists.
-Sections for app features, user cases, and testimonials.
-A call-to-action area with buttons for trying the app or viewing pricing.
-A clean footer with links and social media icons.

Everything is fully responsive, using Flexbox, CSS Grid, and media queries to adapt to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.
